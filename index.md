## About Me
I'm a PhD from the Computer Science Dept. from the University of Buenos Aires and currently a Post-doctoral fellow at the Psychology, Neuroscience and Behaviour Dept. at McMaster University. My research focus is on rhythm cognition. I have previously focused on developing models of [beat expectation](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0242207), with focus on producing observations of relevance for experimental research.
I am mostly interested in how the timing of events can produce affective responses in a listener.
