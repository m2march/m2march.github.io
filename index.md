## About Me
I'm a Computer Scientist currently researching rhythm cognition. I focus on
developing models of [beat expectation](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0242207), 
with focus on producing observations of relevance for experimental research.
I am mostly interested in how the timing of events can produce affective
respones in a listener.

### In progress

#### Experimental Psychology

* Experiment evaluating how internal representations of stimuli changes how we process it: whether motor representation of a distractor in a synchronization task makes it more or less distracting.
* Experiment evaluating how two partner dance learning strategies (dancing with a repeating partner or dancing with multiple partners) compares to learn haptic communication.

#### Computational modelling

* Modelling the proces of inferencing of rhythmic structure and repetition through probabilistic grammars.
